# Hercules
This a test fun project
This is a philanthropic side-project.

Project "Hercules" is a small android application that revolves around the idea to serve as a helpful tool to people who suffer from diabetes.
Application main purpose is to offer basic calculations of insulin intake along with tracking past results via graph.
Aplication offers login via facebook, for this purpouse facebook ID is hidded and that is the only thing that makes application none operable.

Since there is more consuting to do in regards what should be the main calculations of the app, database is not normalized for now.
Bare in mind that UI is not done yet, colors positioning and there are fragments to be done.
